# HOUSE - Housing Off Campus Students Everywhere

The purpose of this web app is to help college students find housing.  Consolidating information and deciding where to live can be a hassle— HOUSE aims to facilitate the process by providing an easy way to save listings and make comparisons. Users can create an account and consequently login, retrieve password, and logout.  The main functionality of the app begins with a web scrape: the user inputs a housing listing link to the main scrape bar.  HOUSE then pulls up a “listing card”, which displays concise information about the listing.  Such information includes listing image, price, address, distance to campus, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage, listing type, and nearby stores.  The user can save listings in folders as well as add them to the “comparison table”, which allows users to view multiple listings side by side to compare information.  Users can access their folders to view saved listings, as well as sort the listings in the folders by price, distance, and number of bedrooms.
